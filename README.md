## Note

This is a fork of [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue), this fork was made because [create-vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/create-vuetify) fails to produce a project that is configured correctly, the issue might be with vuetify-vite, or smth else, point is, you can't really use it.

Since I've found myself following the [manual steps](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/#manual-steps) everytime I make a project, I decided to make my own template, cause why not?

## Usage

```sh
npx ArjixWasTaken/create-vuetify#dist
```
